				<h3>HTML</h3>
				<p>HyperText Markup Language</p>
				<p>It is a markup language used for making the baseline structure of a webpage. It tells the browser what elements should be present during the initial rendering of the page and how to format them. It is the standard language used in most webpages. </p>

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>Cascading Style Sheets</p>
				<p>A styling language that works alongside markup languages like HTML. It is used to add pretty colors and offers a more complex, but flexible method of formatting webpages. CSS styling can be coded into an HTML document, either in the head tag or in-line via the style attribute. However, CSS stylesheets are most commonly a separate file linked through the link tag.</p>
